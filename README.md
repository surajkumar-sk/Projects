# Front End

1. ## Sarvh

    I am not allowed to share the code for the page but you can vist the
    beta version of the website which is an old version made
    public in november 2021 following (this link)[https://sarvh.herokuapp.com]

2. ## Hompage - 1
    This was the first homepage that i designed and coded as intro for 
    myself. I named the website theme as Mysterious Land because it looks
    like a blue land emerging from dark blue and white gradient space displaying
    my details and links.

3. ## About Me
    I was just browsing for some inspiration for displaying a small story on a
    website. Then I came across this concept of hijacking the scroll and make
    the browser scroll divs as per my story. So I implemented the concept to 
    design my about me page. Keep scrolling **slowly** and you are in for a fun Ride.

5. ## Homepage - 2
    This was my next Homepage after Homepage-1 (I know design degraded a bit). It's
    a page that contains minimum components and direct Links. I name the Theme for the
    website as Lights On (you'll know why when you visit the page ;-)

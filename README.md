**Currently I have divided my projects into three sections**

- [Front-end](#front-end) 
- [Back-end](#back-end)
- [Mini Projects](#mini-projects)

This page ReadMe file contains a brief description about the Major projects
that i have rights to share, you can find more details and code for the
projects by following the links in this file or by browsing the repository.

# Front End

1. ## Sarvh

    I am not allowed to share the code for the page but you can vist the
    beta version of the website which is an old version made
    public in november 2021 following (this link)[https://sarvh.herokuapp.com]

2. ## Hompage - 1
    This was the first homepage that i designed and coded as intro for 
    myself. I named the website theme as Mysterious Land because it looks
    like a blue land emerging from dark blue and white gradient space displaying
    my details and links.

3. ## About Me
    I was just browsing for some inspiration for displaying a small story on a
    website. Then I came across this concept of hijacking the scroll and make
    the browser scroll divs as per my story. So I implemented the concept to 
    design my about me page. Keep scrolling **slowly** and you are in for a fun Ride.

5. ## Homepage - 2
    This was my next Homepage after Homepage-1 (I know design degraded a bit). It's
    a page that contains minimum components and direct Links. I name the Theme for the
    website as Lights On (you'll know why when you visit the page ;-)

# Back End

1. ## Sarvh
    While I worked as an intern and then Web Development Team lead I implemented a 
    lot of backend logic, implemented ElasticSearch, managed team code and guided
    them towards writing efficient and readable code(my personal projects would 
    reflect those :-), Managed DataBase and hosted their site on Heroku then
    Netlify and then AWS.

2. ## Admission Form Server
    A school did admissions on paper and it became very hard to print copies of forms and
    finding a student details, so I implemented a server for them. This server return a 
    HTML form to be filled with students details and then after submit server processes
    the data and generates a pdf file with the details and send them to the user and also 
    save the copy of the data into an excel file, which can be downloaded to search for
    students details on later date.

# Mini Projects

    This project is a basic feeds page with features like lazy loading, like ,comment , remove like and comment, and basic auth(frontend auth I didn't wanna complicate the project or divert the purpose of project).

2. ## Instagram Bot
    When i was learning about servers and data bases, I realized every action that we
    do on instagram is basically an api calls. So , why not read the api calls and make a
    bot(I heard it helps a lot in marketing). So i made this project around that time.
    This bot can easily be configured and used by anyone. It can like posts , comment on posts,
    get a users follower list, get top 5 posts of a user and more...

3. ## Form Data to Certificates
    My father is a part of a Teachers Group named "Navodaya Granti". They are a huge
    Group with 1000+ teachers. Major part of there activity was to quiz teachers and
    provide them with certificates. The quiz was taken using Google form, there were a lot
    of google apps out there that automatically converts form data to Pdf certificates and
    send them to users but all of them had a limit on number of Certificates they sent which
    was an issue with a huge number of teachers taking the quiz. So I implemented a Project
    to take the data in an excel file and make certificates as PDf and store them for 
    later distribution. I didn't have much time otherwise i would have made a way to 
    configure details that needs to be on certificate.

4. ## Sorting Excel Data
    There was a need for sorting Telangana Teachers data depending on a list of factors, 
    I implemented a server to take an excel file as an input and had the logic and parameters
    for sorting data hard coded in js. The actual sorting was done manually by some officers
    my sorting server was used just to check for any possible mistakes that might have
    occured while sorting the data.

5. ## Teachers Info
    This website takes district name and designation as a form data and returns all
    the teachers details who work in that district under that designation. Behind
    the scene the server just has a Search algorithm that takes form data does
    the search in excel file and returns all the matching entries.

**There are a lot of other minor projects that I made. The list mentioned above are enough to justify that I can make any type of Website both frontend and backend using both Javascript and python**

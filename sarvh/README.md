## Intro - 
    
I started working on Sarvh as an intern in Spetember 2021 for two months and after that i was
hired as a Freelance Web Dev Team lead in December 2021. There were a lot of Challenges that were fun
to solve while developing Sarvh's Webiste. It's still a work under progress But there is Beeta Version of
Site that was Launched in the Month of November [[link](https://sarvh.herokuapp.com)] . 

- Sarvh is a basically an integration of Social media and Ecommerce website providing a social media platform experience while shopping to their users.

- Initially when I joined as an intern, Sarvh Architecture was Heroku as backend, MongoDB for Database and ReactJs, Redux and few other libraries for frontend.

- As an intern I built a lot of reusable web components with react which were device responsive and made sure its performance was at best, because in react a single unhandled hook or state variable can degrade the apps performance drastically. I managed Redux along with the team.

- Costs of maintaining a server at heroku along with MongoDB were pretty high and scalability was not cheap too especially for a startup like Sarvh where traffic can be unpredictable and money spent should be minimum without compromising on performance or features.

- AWS pay per use and auto scale model was best suited for this type of startup. When I finished my internship I proposed to shift the Database from MongoDB to dynamoDB and server from heroku to EC2 instance of AWS. I also proposed to use Elastic search which I later taught can be replaced with a simple search algorithm on backend.

- As a team lead I along with the team planned and Integrated DynamoDB, EC2 and S3 making sure that we incur minimum costs for read and write on DynamoDB and S3 to reduce costs of usage.
